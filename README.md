This is a super simple interpreter that I'm creating while following the book [writing an interpreter in go](https://interpreterbook.com/)

I already built the monkey programming language a while ago, so for now, I'll rebuild it and then, make any changes I feel like.

This is not supposed to be a "usable" language!
